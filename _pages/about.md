I am currently a first-year master student in Biostatistics at the University of Michigan. Before that, I obtained my Bachelor of Science in Statistics (Data Science Track) at the Shanghai University of Finance and Economics, where I was advised by Prof. [Wanyun Cui](https://cuiwanyun.github.io/).

My current research interest focus on: 

- LLM as easily-editable knowledge bases for query.
- LLM as authentic reasoner for extending scientific frontiers.
- Broader applications of AI for Science.

I am currently seeking a Ph.D. position for Fall 2024.
